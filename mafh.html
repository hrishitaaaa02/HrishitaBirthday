        <p>One of the sweetest person I have come across is hrishita ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
            Too good a person and my forever buddy and kiddo(iykyk üòÇ). The only good thing BD did was making my path come across u and Vanshika. Just love having all those cringy, awkward, happy, sad and all sorts of conversations with you. We haven't met yet but that milestone will be reached super soon nd I can't be more excited....
           You are such a non judgemental person and I absolutely love that about you(that's one of the many things üòÇ). Also pls keep on making all the trip plans you make. They give hope that one day we'll all meet and everything will be very good.
           Also continue sending all ur goofy snaps that can make us smile. You are A sorry THE very special one...
