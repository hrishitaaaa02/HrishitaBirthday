        <p style="font-size: xxx-large;">Still remember this meet when we ourselves weren't sure as to who all will turn up😂
        But eventually we 4 did and it was a great day...the start of an invaluable friendship.
        We went for bowling where 3 of us were the first ones to bowl😂😂.Still it was great fun🔥🔥Vanshika se to ho nhi paya par thik hai Insta story ke layak sabne acha kar liya😌😌
        
        Then we roamed around a bit and were still deciding where to go and have food, when you suggested Chowman..and bro what a place it was!!🔥🔥The food was delicious, and the chopstick game we played(where Rohit failed more miserably than anyone😂😂).
        We were just roaming around then and it was still fun.I guess it's the people who make trips memorable and not the destination alor food itslef💫💫
        We then went to city centre 2, although Protyush had other plans🙃. Photoshoots at the terris were awesome, and then somehow Rohit managed to make a blunder by forgetting the sweater, and as always it was someone else who had to pay for it😂😂
        
        All in all, it was an awesome day, and it wouldn't have been so without you Hrishita💞💞.We are so lucky to have met that day💝
        So we wish you a  very happy birthday and may God bless you with all the happiness in the world❤️❤️(because you deserve it)</p>
